# DS-Checker

Standalone checker to verify the correctness of programming contest submissions.

## Usage

`usage: main.py [-h] [-t TIMELIMIT] [-n] [-d DIRECTORY] file input_folder answer_folder checker`

## Positional Arguments

* `file`: submission file. Can be a `.c`, `.cpp`, `.py2`, `.py`, `.java` or an executable.
* `input_folder`: folder containing the test cases.
* `answer_folder`: folder contaning the answers for each test case in `input_folder`.
* `checker`: binary or executable script which, given the test case, the output generated by the submission and the expected answer, gives a veredict (AC, WA or TLE). (**Must follow testlib checker pattern**)

## Optional arguments
* `-t TIMELIMIT`: specifies that the submission must run under `TIMELIMIT` seconds for each test case.
* `-n`: if this flag is given, the checker is not stopped when a Runtime Error or a Wrong Answer is found.
* `-d`: output directory. This is the root folder to the directory containing the executable and the output files generated by the submission.
